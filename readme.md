monomer

A VST2 Plugin that enables the user to convert stereo signals to mono and/or swap the left and right channels.  
It's heavily inspired by [DFX]()'s Monomaker, in fact I wrote this because I needed something to replace it when I wanted to finish some tracks on a macbook that didn't support 64bit plugins. Since starting this, I've learned that the original plugin is now available as an 64bit AU so this one's basically obsolete, but I'm keeping it around for portfolio reasons and to experiment with releasing projects on github.
The fact it's written in go makes it very and even cross-compilable.
